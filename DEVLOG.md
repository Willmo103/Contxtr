# Development Log

## 2024-10-27: Project Initialization
### Decision: Complete Rebuild
After analyzing the original RepoScribe codebase, decided to rebuild from scratch under the name Contxtr. Key reasons:
- Need for better architecture and separation of concerns
- Desire to implement proper dependency injection
- Want to establish better patterns from the start
- Plan to extend functionality beyond original scope

### Initial Setup
- Created new solution structure
- Established core project architecture
- Set up initial documentation
- Created GitHub repository

### Technology Decisions
1. Staying with .NET 8.0 for core functionality because:
   - Strong type system
   - Excellent tooling
   - Cross-platform capability
   - Familiarity with ecosystem

2. Planning Python integration for:
   - AI/ML functionality
   - Natural language processing
   - Existing ML model compatibility

### Challenges Faced
1. **Architecture Design:**
   - Struggled with deciding on proper separation of concerns
   - Researched various architectural patterns
   - Settled on clean architecture with clear boundaries

2. **Scope Management:**
   - Temptation to add too many features
   - Decided to focus on core document processing first
   - Created roadmap for future features

### Next Steps
1. Implement core document processing
2. Set up proper testing framework
3. Establish CI/CD pipeline
4. Begin work on persistence layer
